# MNPBEM-GUI
GUI for MNPBEM with extended functionality 

Requires matlab (and Phased array system toolbox for certain functions). The MNPBEM17 folder is included 
as found in http://physik.uni-graz.at/mnpbem/ and does not contain my own code.

When using MNPBEM GUI please reference the work according to http://physik.uni-graz.at/mnpbem/ 
and acknowledge the use of the MNPBEM-GUI and the GUI author's code (Nikolaos Matthaiakakis) in the acknowledgement section.

For more information about the MNPBEM-GUI please read the user manual that can be found in the help subdirectory.

To avoid pathing errors, once downloaded, rename the MNPBEM_GUI-master folder to simply MNPBEM_GUI.

The results calculated with MNPBEM GUI have been tested against experimental results and also against the default MNPBEM simulation tool and have been found to have excellent agreement. Nevertheless, the user should make sure that the results of their simulation are correct. Any error is of no responsibility of the GUI author.
